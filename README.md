The Lion Programming Language version 0.1a
==========================================

High level, idiomatic scripting language for agnostic telemetry programming 
on top of the Savannah Framework.

Lion's proposed main features:

  - Simplicity and explicitness
  - Support for translated key words
  - Human language-like syntax, while trying to preserve powerful OOP features.
  - Support for Python extensions
  

## Context and purpose

Savannah is a copyrighted advanced data harvesting and monitoring framework written in Python. At first, it was thought to be strictly private, proprietary and closed-source. However, as it grew in capabilities, a need to provide ways to expand and customise Savannah's potential arose. These ways are materialised in Savannah's official open-source SDK, that will include a client-side Python library, an API for Savannah Cloud service and the Lion Programming Language.
